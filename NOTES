Dealing with missing data:
* listwise deletion: remove from the data the incomplete records
* pairwise deletion: instead of removing the entire records, pairwise deletion simply do not take into account the missing data for the calculation where they are involved

Imputation:
* easy: just replace NaN by the mean of the rest of values
