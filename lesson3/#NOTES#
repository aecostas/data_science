Why are statistical significance tests useful?
  - they provide a formalized framework for comparing
  and evaluating data
  - they enable us to evaluate whether perceived
  effects in our datasets reflect differences
  accross the whole population

Many tests might make assumptions about data's distribution.
The common one is Normal or Gaussian distribution

t-test
------
accept or reject a NULL hypothesis, that is, a statement
we are trying to disprove by running our test

formulas por t and v


What if data is not normal?
---------------------------
Check if data is normal -> shapiro-wild test

w, p = scipy.stats.shapiro (data)
w -> shapiro-wild test statistic
p ->p-value (like in t-test)

Non-parametric test
-------------------
Tests do not assume data is normal:

* mann-whitney U test: test null hypothesis that two populations are the same
u, p = scipy.stats.mannwhitneyu(x,y)



R^2 -> c√≥mo de buena es el modelo
